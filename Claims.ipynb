Have you made any changes to the data to enable further analysis? Remember to describe what you did for every column in the data. \n\n*Write your description here*\n\nThe original data is 99 rows and 8 columns. First, in the Time to close column, there was one negative value maybe because of the typo input. So this one need to be covert to positive value. Second, in the claim amount column, we need to remove the initial 'R' for every value which convert to the numeric value. Next, the the Cause column, we replaced the empty value with \"unknown\". After these changes, the dataset detail were:\n\n- There were 98 unique claim ID, as expected.\n- There were 96 values of 98 entries for time to close, some of value are repetitive by coincidence.\n- Range of claim amount from 3555 to 936540.\n- Range of amount paid from 999.68 to 558725.77, all the amount paid are less than the relative claim amount, as expected.\n- There are 4 unique locations, as expected.\n- Individuals on Claim from 0 to 41.\n- There are two types for linked cases column, as expected.\n- There are three categories of cause, as expected.\n\n","metadata":{"tags":[]},"id":"d1b1a012-1ccb-40e7-a1ad-77b60b256690","cell_type":"markdown"},{"source":"## Data Discovery and Visualization\n\nDescribe what you found in the analysis and how the visualizations answer the customer questions in the project brief. In your description you should:\n- Include at least two different data visualizations to demonstrate the characteristics of single variables\n- Include at least one data visualization to demonstrate the relationship between two or more variables\n- Describe how your analysis has answered the business questions in the project brief\n\n*Write your description here*\n\n**● How does the number of claims differ across locations?**\n\nTotally 98 claims were come from 4 different locations. The highest number of claims happened from Sao Luis, which reach 30 cases in total. Recife had 25 claim cases which ranked the second claims number among the four locations. Fortaleza and Natal had 22 and 21 cases respectively which became third and fourth place in terms of the claims number. In general, all the four locations had  20-30 cases, that is relatively close.\n\n![Q1-1](./Q1-1.png)\n\n**● What is the distribution of time to close claims?**\n\nFirst, we focus on is there any outlier of those time to close values. We created 8 time range groups from 0 to 3500 days, and the range size is 500. Then we noticed that there might be one outlier belonging 3500 group, and no case in 3000 group, which seems far from other cases. However, when we look at the detail, the longest time to close was 3591 days and the second was 2997 days, which were in the reasonable claim period. So we decided there is no outlier among these values.\n\n![Q2-1](./Q2-1.png)\n\nNext, we turn to analyse the distribution of time to close claims. As we can see from the graph, the largest number of claim (37 cases) had been close claims within 500 days and 30 cases had been finished in 1000 days. These two large groups had been accounted for around 68% of total cases, which completed in the regular time frame. On the contrary, there are 8 cases that had been done more than 2000 days including 2 abnormal cases which completed over 2500 days. We suggest these cases need to be figure out why took so long and is there any optimisation of process for these issues.\n\n![Q2-2](./Q2-2.png)\n\n**● How does the average time to close claims differ by location?**\n\nThe average of time to close claims by 4 different locations are from 581 to 1030 days. The longest average time to close (1030 days) belongs to Sao Luis which was also the largest number of claims in there. And the loaction of the lowest number of cases- Natal had the shortest average time to close (581 days) , which is nearly half of the longest average time to close. We summarised that one of the efficiency causes of claims progress in each location depended on the what is the total number of claims in here.\n\n![Q3-1](./Q3-1.png)\n","metadata":{"tags":[]},"id":"714a7083-7a43-4b0b-8ed4-2675efc87691","cell_type":"markdown"},{"source":"## ✅ When you have finished...\n-  Publish your Workspace using the option on the left\n-  Check the published version of your report:\n\t-  Can you see everything you want us to grade?\n    -  Are all the graphics visible?\n-  Review the grading rubric, have you included everything that will be graded?\n-  Head back to the [Certification Dashboard](https://app.datacamp.com/certification) to submit your practical exam","metadata":{"tags":[]},"id":"f635131a-00f8-44dd-b610-509db41c1154","cell_type":"markdown"}],"metadata":{"colab":{"name":"Welcome to DataCamp Workspaces.ipynb","provenance":[]},"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3 (ipykernel)","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"file_extension":".py","mimetype":"text/x-python","name":"python","nbconvert_exporter":"python","pygments_lexer":"ipython3","version":"3.8.10"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":5}
